## Project Overview

YOMU is a personal anime/manga tracking web app built with Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and Supabase (Postgres + auth). Live at `manga-tracker-hazel.vercel.app`. All core features are active: library tracking, series grouping, discovery, airing calendar, sync, stats, sharing, Chrome extension for watch tracking, and community totals crowd-sourcing. This session fixed four code-review regressions (cron auth, duplicate detector, ESLint noise, missing migrations), corrected Netflix tracking in the extension popup, and fixed a series total-episodes edit bug that was producing wrong sums on grouped anime cards.

## Current State

### Latest Changes

#### Session 33 — Phase 3: filter dock reconciliation + Release Calendar mobile layout (2026-06-10)

**3a — Filter dock decision: filters stay in `app/page.tsx`**
- Read `components/Sidebar.tsx` in full. Sidebar is **navigation-only**: nav links, "Now Reading" hero (top reading entry), weekly chapter/episode stats, streak badge, "Up Next" list. Zero filtering controls.
- Filters in `app/page.tsx` (status tabs, type-filter pills, mood filter, search, sort) have no counterpart in Sidebar — no duplication exists.
- Decision: filters remain in `app/page.tsx`. No change to either file for 3a. Documented here so a future agent doesn't re-investigate.

**3b — Release Calendar mobile layout (`components/ReleaseCalendar.tsx`)**
- **Problem:** Day strip buttons used `width: ${100/7}%` — on narrow viewports all 14 day pills were squished to ~24px each (unusable touch targets).
- **Fix 1:** Changed pill width to `clamp(52px, calc(100% / 7), 64px)`. On mobile (360–420px screens) each pill is 52px — 6–7 fit in view and the rest scroll. On wide screens the `calc(100% / 7)` term caps at 64px so pills don't balloon.
- **Fix 2:** Added `scrollSnapType: 'x mandatory'` + `WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'` on the strip container; `scrollSnapAlign: 'start'` on each pill. Strip now snaps cleanly when swiped.
- **Fix 3:** Added `dayStripRef` + `useEffect` to call `scrollIntoView({ inline: 'center', behavior: 'smooth' })` on the `data-today="true"` pill on mount — today is centred automatically instead of showing day 1.
- Added `useRef` to the import.
- Build passes. Zero new ESLint errors.

#### Session 32 — Phase 2: container-query grid + card visual hierarchy (2026-06-10, commits `08e4884` + `bc...`)

**2a — Container-query grid (`app/page.tsx`)**
- Replaced `style={{ gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax(360px, 1fr))' }}` with a `@container` wrapper + Tailwind CSS 4 container-query classes.
- Structure: outer `<div className="@container">` wraps inner `<div className="grid grid-cols-1 @[740px]:grid-cols-2 @[1120px]:grid-cols-3 gap-3">`.
- Breakpoints chosen to match the ~360px card minimum (740px ≈ 2 cards + gap; 1120px ≈ 3 cards + gap).
- No new dependencies — Tailwind CSS 4 has container queries built in.

**2b — Card visual hierarchy (`app/page.tsx`)**

Tier 1 (always visible, full contrast — no hover required):
- `ThumbsUp` / `ThumbsDown` buttons: base colour raised from `text-zinc-700` (near-invisible) → `text-zinc-500`.
- Rating label text (`Liked` / `Disliked` / `Not Rated`): was always `text-zinc-700`; now colour-coded — `text-emerald-400` (liked), `text-red-400` (disliked), `text-zinc-500` (unrated). Visible on touch devices without hover.
- "Rating" section label: `text-zinc-700` → `text-zinc-500`.
- Chapter progress label (`Ch. X / Y`): `text-zinc-500` → `text-zinc-300` so current progress reads clearly at a glance.

Tier 2 (always visible, reduced contrast):
- `"Studio:"` prefix label: `text-zinc-700` → `text-zinc-500`.
- `"Unknown author/studio"` fallback: `text-zinc-700` → `text-zinc-500`.
- Genre tags: `text-zinc-500` → `text-zinc-400`; capped at 3 (was 5) per spec.
- `"No Genres Listed"` fallback: `text-zinc-700` → `text-zinc-500`.

No information is now hover-only. Hover effects remain as enhancements only.

---

#### Session 31 — Phase 1: DetailModal extracted into components/DetailView.tsx (2026-06-10, commit `1d001d3`)

**Extraction: `components/DetailView.tsx` (new file)**
- `DetailModal`, `RelationMergeButton`, `SeriesPanel`, and `EditableNumber` moved out of `app/page.tsx` into this dedicated file.
- All four are exported named exports; `app/page.tsx` imports them from `@/components/DetailView`.
- `DetailModal` is also exported as `DetailModalProps` interface so callers can type the prop spread if needed.

**Isolated loading boundaries (the key structural change)**
- The single monolithic `useEffect` that fired all 8 API calls in parallel (blocking pattern) is now split into 8 separate `useEffect` hooks, each with its own `loading` state:
  - `alLoading` — AniList manga (mal_id → MANGA)
  - AniList anime — no skeleton; only renders when data arrives
  - `notifyLoading` — notify.moe scores → `ScoresSkeleton` while pending
  - `wikiLoading` — Wikipedia summary → `WikiSkeleton` while pending
  - `muLoading` — MangaUpdates badges skeleton (single short bar)
  - `jikanRecsLoading` — Jikan recs → `RecsSkeleton` while pending
  - `relationsLoading` — Jikan relations (for Series Map button)
  - OMDB/IMDb — no loading state; renders silently when key is present
- Skeleton components (`Skeleton`, `ScoresSkeleton`, `WikiSkeleton`, `RelationsSkeleton`, `RecsSkeleton`) are file-private helpers in `DetailView.tsx`.
- `app/page.tsx` — removed inline function bodies (~1 500 lines); import line updated.
- Build passes. ESLint errors dropped from 67 → 63 (baseline was 67 at time of work; original brief cited 56 — discrepancy was pre-existing `.vercel/` noise before session 25 fix).

---

#### Session 30 — Jikan proxy, warmup auth, Wikipedia labels, stats useMemo, AniList discovery, incremental grid (2026-06-10, commits `cafc0ad` + `0eb1dab`)

**Incremental grid rendering (`app/page.tsx`)**
- IntersectionObserver sentinel: library grid renders only first 40 cards on load, loads 20 more as sentinel scrolls into view (400px pre-load). Resets to 40 on filter/search/mood change. Zero new dependencies.

**AniList discovery catalog (`app/api/swipe-queue/route.ts`)**
- Replaced static Jikan `/top/manga` (same 50 titles every call) with two AniList GraphQL fetches against random pages 1–100 (SCORE_DESC, no adult). Up to 100 varied candidates per request. AniList `averageScore` (0–100) normalised ÷10 to match Jikan scale. Jaccard scoring unchanged.
- New `anilistFetch()`, `mapAniListItem()`, `ANILIST_QUERY` helpers added; `jikanFetch`/`mapItem` removed from this file.
- ⚠️ API COST: AniList GraphQL is free and rate-limit is generous. Two random-page fetches per Discover load = 2 calls. No caching (intentional — variety on every visit).

**Jikan direct browser calls (`lib/jikan.ts`, new `app/api/jikan-proxy/route.ts`)**
- New `/api/jikan-proxy?path=...` route: server-side general Jikan proxy with 429 retry (1.2s backoff × 2). Accepts any `/v4` path; allowlist regex prevents open-redirect abuse.
- `jikanGet()`: search paths still → `/api/jikan-search` (cached); all other paths → `/api/jikan-proxy` when in browser; direct to Jikan on server (no CORS concern).
- `getMangaAllRelations`, `getSeriesEntryDetail`, `getJikanEpisodes`, `getJikanEpisodeSynopsis`, `getAnimeAdaptations`: all converted from raw `fetch('https://api.jikan.moe/v4...')` to `jikanGet()`. Removed inline 429 retry boilerplate from `getSeriesEntryDetail` and episode functions (proxy handles it).

**Warmup sub-fetch auth (`proxy.ts`)**
- Added `/api/catalog`, `/api/shonenjump`, `/api/goodreads`, `/api/webtoons`, `/api/mangaplus`, `/api/jikan-proxy` to `isPublicApi` exemption. Cron-triggered `/api/warmup` fan-outs carry no session cookie; these routes were 302-ing to `/login` silently.

**Wikipedia infobox coverage (`app/api/wikipedia/route.ts`)**
- Added label variants to all `parseField` calls: `'Created by'`, `'Original creator'`, `'Drawn by'`, `'English publisher'`, `'Serialized in'`, `'No. of episodes'`, `'Genre(s)'`, `'Animation studio'`, `'Tankōbon'`, `'Series director'`, etc. Improves hit rate on articles with non-standard infobox keys.

**Stats page useMemo (`app/stats/page.tsx`)**
- Added `useMemo` to React imports.
- Extracted `animeStatsSection` (deps: `[animeList]`) and `readingVelocitySection` (deps: `[log]`) from JSX IIFEs into `useMemo` constants placed before the early loading return. Satisfies rules of hooks. Remaining 5 IIFEs (`watchHistorySection`, `watchDnaSection`, `ratingsSection`, `tasteProfileSection`, `analyticsSection`) still inline — safe to convert in a future session.

---

#### Session 29 — Offline-first extension sync + Jaccard discovery (2026-06-09, commit `be23894`)

- `extension/background.js` — Offline-first "store and forward" using `chrome.alarms`. Every event queued with a UUID `idempotency_key`. `chrome.alarms.create('syncFlush', { periodInMinutes: 1 })` wakes the MV3 service worker to flush the queue on schedule. `flushPending()` rewritten: sends entire queue to `/api/watch-event/batch` in one request; on success clears only the sent keys (atomic read-modify-write); on 5xx increments `retryCount` and drops events that exceed `MAX_RETRIES = 5`; on 401 clears the stale auth token. `self.addEventListener('online', ...)` also triggers a flush when the device comes back online.
- `app/api/watch-event/batch/route.ts` — New batch endpoint. Bearer token auth enforced; `user_id` set server-side. Upserts to `watch_sessions` with `onConflict: 'idempotency_key', ignoreDuplicates: true` — retries never double-count. Groups events by title to make one `match_library_entry` RPC call + one library update per show. Capped at 500 events/batch.
- `app/api/swipe-queue/route.ts` — Discover feed scoring upgraded to Jaccard similarity (`|intersection| / |union|`). Taste profile built from two sources: library entries with `status IN ('completed', 'watching')` (genre frequency, `log1p` scaled, weight 0.7) merged with swipe history signal (weight 0.3). Top-12 genres form the profile set. Candidate score = Jaccard × 0.8 + (MAL score / 10) × 0.2. Fisher-Yates shuffle within the top pool for variety. Library genres added as a 5th parallel Supabase query.
- `scripts/migrations.sql` — `watch_sessions` idempotency_key column (4-step: add nullable → backfill `gen_random_uuid()` → NOT NULL → UNIQUE constraint via `DO` block to avoid `IF NOT EXISTS` syntax error). `discover_jaccard_feed` Postgres RPC added (future: requires `discover_cache` table which doesn't exist yet — RPC safe to leave dormant).

#### Session 28 — pg_trgm DB fuzzy match + atomic merge RPC (2026-06-09, commit `9afbf45`)

- `app/api/watch-event/route.ts` — Replaced full JS library scan (loads entire `manga_list` into serverless memory on every extension heartbeat) with a single `match_library_entry` Supabase RPC. DB uses `pg_trgm` GIN indexes on `title` and `anime_title` columns. Threshold kept at 0.65. JS fallback retained if RPC errors. `normalise()`/`matchScore()` kept in file for fallback — no longer the primary path.
- `app/page.tsx` — `mergeMultiple` now uses `merge_entries(keep_id, drop_ids[])` RPC for the delete step. Atomically reassigns `watch_sessions.manga_id` and deletes duplicates in one DB transaction (prevents orphaned watch history if connection drops mid-merge). Both update and merge errors are now surfaced via `showToast` instead of silently failing.
- `scripts/migrations.sql` — Added `pg_trgm` extension, GIN indexes (`manga_list_title_trgm_idx`, `manga_list_anime_title_trgm_idx`), and both RPC function definitions for reproducibility.

#### Session 27 — Fix series total-episodes edit glitch (2026-06-09, commit `4953556`)

- `app/page.tsx` — Fixed `EditableNumber` for total episodes on series-grouped anime cards. **Bug:** `seriesEpTotal` summed ALL members' `total_episodes` (including Jikan-auto-populated sub-entry values), and the save target was `activeEpMember.id` (in-progress member), not the primary card. Typing 56 could result in 56+100=156 and save to the wrong entry. **Fix:** when `epMembers.length > 1`, saves `n` to the primary card (`m.id`) and nulls-out `total_episodes` on all other members so the displayed sum equals exactly what the user typed.

#### Session 26 — Extension: Netflix/streaming platforms show in NOW TRACKING immediately (2026-06-09, commit `268e71a`)

- `extension/background.js` — Added `KNOWN_STREAMING_PLATFORMS` set (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, Hulu, Apple TV+, Tubi) and `isKnownStreamingPlatform()` helper. These platforms now update `yomu_last_tracked` and local session stats **immediately** in `handleEvent` — no longer waiting for an API library-match. Popup NOW TRACKING shows the correct show straight away instead of staying on a stale YouTube entry. DB updates (episode progress, watch time) still require an API library match to prevent non-anime content polluting the library. `sendToAPI` now skips the local stats update for streaming platforms to avoid double-counting (already done optimistically in `handleEvent`). YouTube and unknown sites remain fully gated.

#### Session 25 — Code-review fixes: auth middleware, duplicate detector, ESLint, migrations (2026-06-09, commit `b0cee03`)

- `proxy.ts` — Fixed cron jobs silently dead: auth middleware was 307-redirecting all Vercel Cron requests (no session cookie) to `/login`. Added `/api/cron/*` and `/api/warmup` to the public-API exemption. Routes secure themselves via `CRON_SECRET` Bearer header. Chapter-alert cron is now reachable.
- `components/DuplicateDetector.tsx` — Fixed `pairKey` order-dependence: was `` `${p.a.id}::${p.b.id}` `` (positional). If library re-sorted between sessions the same pair produced a different key and dismissed duplicates reappeared. Now `[p.a.id, p.b.id].sort().join('::')`. Also surfaced upsert errors: `dismiss()` now checks the Supabase result and calls `showToast` on failure instead of silently dropping it.
- `eslint.config.mjs` — Added `".vercel/**"` to `globalIgnores`. ESLint was linting minified build output in `.vercel/output/`, inflating problem count from 56 real issues to 3,067 noise entries.
- `scripts/migrations.sql` — Added `user_settings` and `chapter_notifications` DDL with RLS (both keyed on `auth.uid()`). Tables existed only in the live Supabase instance; the repo had no DDL for them. Both confirmed present in production (verified via Supabase MCP).

### Outstanding Tasks

- [x] **Phase 2: container-query card grid + card visual hierarchy** — Completed session 32. Grid uses `@container` / `@[740px]:grid-cols-2` / `@[1120px]:grid-cols-3`. Rating and progress are now Tier 1 (visible without hover). Genres capped at 3.

- [x] **Phase 3: filter dock reconciliation + Calendar mobile layout** — Sidebar is navigation-only; filters correctly stay in `app/page.tsx` (no change needed). Calendar day strip fixed: `clamp(52px…)` pill widths, `scrollSnapType`, auto-scroll to today on mount. Completed session 33.

- [ ] **Phase 4: continue decomposing `app/page.tsx`** — After Phase 2 sign-off, continue extracting components (card grid, filter bar, header). `app/page.tsx` is currently ~2 650 lines after Phase 1.

- [ ] **Reload Chrome extension** — `background.js` changed in session 29. Go to `chrome://extensions` and click Reload on YOMU. The `syncFlush` alarm registers on next install/reload.

- [x] **Web-push notifications** — VAPID env vars confirmed set on Vercel (session 30).

- [x] **Feature request button** — `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` + `Google_Sheet_ID` confirmed set on Vercel (session 30). Code handles both `Google_Sheet_ID` and `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` casings.

- [x] **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY on Vercel** — confirmed set (session 30).

- [x] **Warmup route sub-fetches** — `/api/catalog`, `/api/shonenjump`, `/api/goodreads`, `/api/webtoons`, `/api/mangaplus` added to `isPublicApi` in `proxy.ts` (session 30).

- [x] **Jikan direct browser calls** — all 5 functions converted to `jikanGet()`; new `/api/jikan-proxy` route handles non-search paths in browser (session 30).

- [x] **Wikipedia infobox coverage** — additional label variants added to all `parseField` calls (session 30).

- [ ] **Stats page remaining IIFEs** — `app/stats/page.tsx` still has 5 inline IIFEs: `watchHistorySection` (line ~522), `watchDnaSection` (line ~822), `ratingsSection` (line ~986), `tasteProfileSection` (line ~1275), `analyticsSection` (line ~1353). Convert to `useMemo` constants placed before the early return (same pattern as `animeStatsSection` and `readingVelocitySection` already done). Each needs deps: watchHistory/DNA → `[watchSessions, manga]`; ratings → `[manga, animeList]`; tasteProfile/analytics → `[manga, log]`. `showAllSessions` also needed for watchHistorySection. Do NOT change the nested IIFE inside watchHistorySection (SVG sparkline at line ~644). Safe to defer.

- [ ] **menome.in.th integration** — No public API found. Currently listed as "planned" on Sources page.

- [ ] **Infra: move repo out of synced folder** — stale `.git/index 2` / `.git/index 3` files from iCloud/Drive/Dropbox sync inside `.git/`. Risk of repository corruption. Exclude `.git`, `.next`, `node_modules`, `.vercel` from sync scope and delete the stale numbered files.

## Known Issues & Regressions

### UrlImportModal closes immediately on interaction — 2026-06-08
- **Symptom:** Clicking inside the "Import From URL" modal closed the DetailModal.
- **Root cause:** Modal renders inside backdrop div with `onClick={onClose}`. `mousedown` fired before `click` could be stopped.
- **Fix:** `components/UrlImportModal.tsx` — added `onMouseDown={e => e.stopPropagation()}`.
- **Prevention rule:** Any modal inside a backdrop `onClick={onClose}` div must have BOTH `onClick` AND `onMouseDown` stopPropagation on its outermost element.

### MangaDex chapters showing "No data" in browser — 2026-06-08
- **Symptom:** Expanding the 📖 Chapters section in DetailModal always showed "No chapter data found."
- **Root cause:** `lib/jikan.ts` called `api.mangadex.org` directly from the client. MangaDex blocks CORS.
- **Fix:** `app/api/mangadex/route.ts` — server-side proxy. Updated `lib/jikan.ts` to call `/api/mangadex`.
- **Prevention rule:** Never call MangaDex (or any CORS-restrictive API) directly from the browser. Always proxy through a Next.js API route.

### Auto-sync gauges overwriting independent progress — 2026-06-08
- **Symptom:** Advancing chapters silently overwrote `episodes_watched` and vice versa.
- **Root cause:** `commitChapterProgress` computed proportional `syncEp` and wrote it to DB.
- **Fix:** `app/page.tsx` — removed sync calculations from both commit functions.
- **Prevention rule:** Never write `episodes_watched` inside `commitChapterProgress` or `current_chapter` inside `commitEpisodeProgress`.

### Extension "Connect to YOMU" gave no feedback — 2026-06-08
- **Symptom:** Clicking "Connect to YOMU" opened the YOMU site but nothing happened — popup closed, dot stayed red.
- **Root cause:** `popup.js` called `window.close()` immediately after `chrome.tabs.create()`.
- **Fix:** Removed `window.close()`; popup polls `GET_STATUS` every 500ms. Content script pushes token via `SET_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- **Prevention rule:** Never `window.close()` a popup waiting for an async result. Always keep open until result confirmed.

### Vercel alternating Error/Ready builds — 2026-06-08
- **Symptom:** Every `git push` triggered one Error + one Ready deployment.
- **Root cause:** One Vercel build worker had stale `lib/jikan.ts` cache.
- **Fix:** Added a version comment to `lib/jikan.ts` to bust the cache hash.
- **Prevention rule:** If you see alternating Error/Ready with "export not found", touch the affected module with a comment. Run `npx vercel deploy --prod --force` once to flush.

### streaming-sites API returned 401 for extension — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Extension's `fetchCustomSites()` always got 401.
- **Root cause:** Route used cookie-only auth; extension sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Fix:** `app/api/streaming-sites/route.ts` — dual-mode auth (Bearer first, cookie fallback).
- **Prevention rule:** Any API route called by the extension must support Bearer token auth. Cookie-only routes are browser-only.

### Netflix episode counter never advancing — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Watching on Netflix didn't increment the episode counter.
- **Root cause (1):** Netflix title has no episode number → `episode: null` → API skipped `episodes_watched` update.
- **Root cause (2):** MV3 service worker terminates after ~30s; `send()` silently dropped events.
- **Fix:** DOM-scrape Netflix player for `S1:E5`; API increments by 1 when `is_complete && safeEpisode == null`; `send()` retries once after 1s.
- **Prevention rule:** Never silently swallow errors in `send()`. API must handle `episode: null` for `is_complete` events.

### notify.moe CORS blocked in browser — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Direct browser fetch to `notify.moe` API fails with CORS error.
- **Root cause:** notify.moe API blocks cross-origin browser requests.
- **Fix:** `app/api/notifymoe/route.ts` — server-side proxy with 24h cache in `anilist_cache` table.
- **Prevention rule:** Never call notify.moe directly from the browser. Always use `/api/notifymoe` proxy.

### notify.moe scores never rendering (stale null cache) — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** notify.moe score bars never appeared; every modal open made a fresh API call.
- **Root cause:** When `findNotifyMoeByMalId` returned null, nothing was cached. Infinite miss loop.
- **Fix:** `app/api/notifymoe/route.ts` — upserts `payload: null` on miss; read path uses 2h TTL for nulls.
- **Prevention rule:** Always cache null/miss results with a shorter TTL. Never let a "no data found" path return without writing to cache.

### Vercel build fails on `.catch()` on Supabase upsert — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** `/api/wikipedia` returned 404 in production; entire commit failed to build.
- **Root cause:** `PostgrestFilterBuilder` implements `PromiseLike` (only `.then()`), not `Promise`. Calling `.catch()` on it is `TS2551`.
- **Fix:** `app/api/wikipedia/route.ts:194` and `app/api/notifymoe/route.ts:62` — removed `.catch(() => {})`.
- **Prevention rule:** Never call `.catch()` directly on a Supabase query builder return value. Use `try/catch` around the `await` instead.

### Turbopack RocksDB corruption in dev — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** `next dev` failed with `Failed to open database / invalid digit found in string`.
- **Root cause:** RocksDB SSTable files corrupt when the path contains a space (`Anime Website`).
- **Fix:** `package.json` — `devclean` script. `.claude/launch.json` uses `devclean`.
- **Prevention rule:** Always start dev via `npm run devclean`. Never run `next dev` directly in this project.

### Netflix session log showing blank titles — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Extension session log rows showed `—` with no title.
- **Root cause:** Netflix parser returned `{ title: "" }` when DOM scrape + title parse both failed.
- **Fix:** `extension/content.js` — `if (!show || /^netflix$/i.test(show)) return null`.
- **Prevention rule:** All extension site parsers must return `null` (not empty-title object) on extraction failure.

### Extension flushPending data loss on SW termination — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Offline-queued watch events disappeared after SW woke up.
- **Root cause:** `chrome.storage.local.remove('yomu_pending')` called before the loop. MV3 SW terminates after ~30s.
- **Fix:** `extension/background.js` — removes each item individually after its send completes.
- **Prevention rule:** Never bulk-remove a pending queue before processing in an MV3 SW. Always remove per-item after success.

### Extension aniwatch parser crash on malformed iframe URL — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Tracking silently stopped on aniwatch iframes.
- **Root cause:** `new URL(url)` threw when `_parentContext.url` was empty (async race).
- **Fix:** `extension/content.js` line 70 — wrapped in try-catch.
- **Prevention rule:** Always wrap `new URL(untrustedString)` in try-catch in content scripts.

### Extension popup XSS via custom site hostname — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Potential JS execution in popup via crafted custom-site hostname.
- **Root cause:** `$('sites-list').innerHTML` injected raw storage strings.
- **Fix:** `extension/popup.js` — `createElement`/`textContent` per chip.
- **Prevention rule:** Never use `innerHTML` with data from `chrome.storage.local`. Always use `textContent` or DOM creation.

### swipe_history insert failed with user_id column — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Dismiss X on Discover cards threw Supabase insert error.
- **Root cause:** `swipe_history` table has no `user_id` column.
- **Fix:** Removed `user_id` reference from dismiss insert.
- **Prevention rule:** `swipe_history` does not have `user_id`. Never add it to inserts on that table.

### Duplicate detection falsely flagging series members — 2026-06-08
- **Symptom:** Series members with similar titles appeared in Duplicates tab.
- **Root cause:** Duplicate scan didn't check `series_id`.
- **Fix:** `app/page.tsx` — both scans skip pairs where `a.series_id && a.series_id === b.series_id`.
- **Prevention rule:** Duplicate detection must always skip pairs sharing a non-null `series_id`.

### Cron jobs silently dead (auth middleware redirect) — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Chapter-alert cron never fired. Vercel showed "success" (3xx) but route body never ran.
- **Root cause:** `proxy.ts` only whitelisted `/api/feature-request`. Vercel Cron sends no session cookie → `getUser()` returns null → 307 redirect to `/login`.
- **Fix:** `proxy.ts` — added `/api/cron/*` and `/api/warmup` to `isPublicApi` exemption.
- **Prevention rule:** Any route invoked by Vercel Cron (no session cookie) must be in the `isPublicApi` exemption in `proxy.ts`. Routes secure themselves with `CRON_SECRET`.

### DuplicateDetector dismissals not persisting across sorts — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Dismissed duplicate pairs reappeared after the library re-sorted.
- **Root cause:** `pairKey` was `` `${p.a.id}::${p.b.id}` `` — order depends on list position. Re-sort changes position → different key → saved dismissal doesn't match.
- **Fix:** `components/DuplicateDetector.tsx` — `[p.a.id, p.b.id].sort().join('::')`.
- **Prevention rule:** Any key that identifies a pair of items must be order-independent. Always sort IDs before joining.

### Series total-episodes sum glitch — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Setting total episodes to 56 on a series card resulted in 156 (or similar) after adding series members. Editing the field didn't fix it.
- **Root cause (1):** `seriesEpTotal` sums ALL members' `total_episodes` including Jikan-auto-populated values from sub-entries.
- **Root cause (2):** The `EditableNumber` saved to `activeEpMember.id` (in-progress member) rather than the primary card, so the sum didn't change.
- **Fix:** `app/page.tsx` — in series mode, edit saves `n` to `m.id` (primary card) and nulls `total_episodes` on all other members.
- **Prevention rule:** When editing a "series total" field, always save to the primary card and zero/null the sub-members so the displayed sum equals what was typed. Never save series-level aggregates to a sub-member.

### Extension NOW TRACKING showing stale site (e.g. YouTube) while watching Netflix — 2026-06-09
- **Symptom:** Watching on Netflix left the popup "NOW TRACKING" showing a previous YouTube session.
- **Root cause:** Netflix is not in `DEDICATED_ANIME_SITES`. `yomu_last_tracked` was only updated after API confirmed a library match. If match failed or was slow, the stale entry persisted.
- **Fix:** `extension/background.js` — added `KNOWN_STREAMING_PLATFORMS` set. These platforms update `yomu_last_tracked` and session stats immediately (optimistic), like dedicated anime sites. DB updates still require API match.
- **Prevention rule:** `KNOWN_STREAMING_PLATFORMS` and `DEDICATED_ANIME_SITES` must both be checked in `handleEvent`. New streaming services should be added to one of these sets so local stats update promptly.

## Session Log

### Session — 2026-06-10 (session 33)
- 3a: Sidebar is navigation-only (confirmed by full read). Filters stay in `app/page.tsx` — no duplication, no action required. Documented decision so it isn't re-investigated.
- 3b: Calendar day strip had 14 pills at `100%/7` width — usable on desktop (7 visible), unusable on mobile (14 pills at ~24px each). Fixed with `clamp(52px, calc(100%/7), 64px)` so mobile gets 52px tap targets and desktop stays proportional. Added CSS scroll-snap + `scrollIntoView` on today's pill.
- Build clean, no new ESLint errors. No new dependencies added.

### Session — 2026-06-10 (session 32)
- Phase 2 of UI layout refactor. Two separate commits: grid change first, card hierarchy second (as requested).
- Container-query breakpoints chosen to match 360px card min-width: 740px for 2-col, 1120px for 3-col. Tailwind CSS 4 has no plugin needed for container queries.
- Card hierarchy: the only Tier 1 items that were hidden were the rating buttons and the chapter progress label — all bumped to readable base contrast. No hover-only information remains on cards.
- Genre count reduced from 5 → 3 per spec. Genre tags nudged from `zinc-500` → `zinc-400` (Tier 2, slightly more readable without being Tier 1).
- Build clean; no new ESLint errors.

### Session — 2026-06-10 (session 31)
- Phase 1 of the UI layout refactor: extracted `DetailModal` (~1 500 lines) from `app/page.tsx` into `components/DetailView.tsx`. Also moved `RelationMergeButton`, `SeriesPanel`, `EditableNumber`.
- Key structural change: the original single monolithic `useEffect` (all 8 API calls) was split into 8 isolated effects, each with its own loading state. Slow APIs (Wikipedia, notify.moe, Jikan recs) now show per-section skeletons instead of blocking the whole view.
- `SeriesPanel` was co-located inside the old `page.tsx` SeriesPanel block — moved with the rest. No behaviour changes.
- Build clean. ESLint errors reduced (67 → 63); all new instances of `set-state-in-effect` are pre-existing patterns carried over from the original code, not newly introduced.
- Next step pending user sign-off: Phase 2 (container-query card grid + status badge always-visible).

### Session — 2026-06-10 (session 30)
- User confirmed VAPID, Google Sheets, and Anthropic env vars all set on Vercel — verified via Chrome extension → Vercel dashboard. Marked those tasks done.
- Tackled all 4 remaining code tasks: Jikan proxy (new `/api/jikan-proxy` route + `jikanGet()` updated), warmup auth fix (`proxy.ts` exemptions), Wikipedia infobox labels, stats `useMemo` refactor.
- Stats `useMemo`: converted only `animeStatsSection` and `readingVelocitySection` — the two where the complete IIFE body was confirmed from reads. Remaining 5 IIFEs deferred; they span 100–200 lines each and converting them safely requires reading every line.
- AniList discovery: replaced Jikan `/top/manga` (static 50 titles) with two random AniList GraphQL pages. Every Discover session now draws from a different pool of 100 candidates.
- Incremental grid: IntersectionObserver sentinel in `app/page.tsx` — 40 initial cards, +20 on scroll. Large libraries no longer block the main thread on initial render.
- Deployed `cafc0ad` (grid + AniList) and `0eb1dab` (4 code fixes) to Vercel.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (session 29)
- Continued Gemini consultation from previous session. Implemented two remaining recommendations from Gemini's concrete spec.
- Offline-first extension sync: `chrome.alarms` wakes the MV3 service worker every 60s to flush the pending queue to the new batch endpoint. UUID idempotency keys prevent double-counting on retry. 401 response clears stale tokens so the popup prompts re-auth instead of silently looping.
- `discover_jaccard_feed` Postgres RPC was applied to DB last session but references a `discover_cache` table that doesn't exist. Left dormant — not called anywhere. The JavaScript Jaccard scoring in `swipe-queue/route.ts` is the live implementation.
- Jaccard scoring in swipe-queue now sources taste profile from actual library (completed/watching) genres — more accurate than swipe history alone. The library add gives a stronger signal; swipe history is a lighter correction weight.
- Deployed `be23894` to Vercel. Extension reload required.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (session 28)
- Implemented Gemini's two highest-value recommendations (corrected for actual schema).
- `match_library_entry` RPC: pg_trgm GIN indexes on `title` + `anime_title`. Watch-event route no longer loads full library into memory — single indexed DB query instead. JS fallback retained.
- `merge_entries` RPC: atomically reassigns `watch_sessions` + deletes duplicates in one transaction. Both merge errors now surface via `showToast`. Watch history preserved on merge (was silently lost before).
- Both RPCs added to `migrations.sql`. Applied to production via Supabase MCP.
- Gemini's SQL bugs corrected: table name `library` → `manga_list`; `library_id` → `manga_id`; `title_english`/`title_romaji` removed (columns don't exist); threshold kept at 0.65 (not 0.4).

### Session — 2026-06-09 (sessions 25–27)
- Four code-review findings actioned: (1) cron/warmup paths exempted from auth middleware — chapter-alert cron was silently dead since day one; (2) `pairKey` made order-independent with `.sort()` — dismissals were vanishing after library re-sorts; (3) `.vercel/**` added to ESLint ignores — lint noise dropped from 3,067 to 56; (4) `user_settings` + `chapter_notifications` DDL added to `migrations.sql` — schema was non-reproducible.
- User reported extension popup showing YouTube while watching Saiki K on Netflix. Root cause: Netflix is non-dedicated, so `yomu_last_tracked` only updated after API round-trip. Fixed by adding `KNOWN_STREAMING_PLATFORMS` for optimistic local tracking.
- User reported Saiki K series card showing 156 total episodes after setting 56 and grouping series members. Root cause: sum of all members' `total_episodes` (Jikan-populated), save target was wrong member. Fixed: series-mode edit now saves to primary card and nulls sub-member totals.
- All changes deployed to `manga-tracker-hazel.vercel.app`. Extension reload required by user.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (sessions 22–24)
- Movie cards: repurposed `total_episodes` as runtime minutes; replaced chapter/episode tracker with yellow progress gauge.
- Calendar: AniList queried directly from browser on row click. Detail panel shows streaming links, score, genres, synopsis.
- Extension code review found 3 bugs: `flushPending` data loss, aniwatch `new URL()` crash, popup `innerHTML` XSS. All fixed (`ee9a469`).
- 23 junk `watch_sessions` rows deleted from Supabase. API now gates session logging on library match or known anime site.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (session 21)
- User wanted to fill in details (status, progress, date watched, notes, rating) at add time instead of hunting the card afterwards.
- Collapsible quick-details panel added below confirmed-title chip. Status pills context-aware per content type. All fields optional.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (session 20)
- Critical Vercel build failure: two `TS2551` errors (`PostgrestFilterBuilder` is `PromiseLike` not `Promise`; can't call `.catch()` on it). Fixed in `app/api/wikipedia/route.ts` and `app/api/notifymoe/route.ts`.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (sessions 18–19)
- Wikipedia `/api/wikipedia` proxy built (summary + infobox; 72h cache). Wikipedia panel in DetailModal.
- notify.moe null-cache loop fixed (2h miss TTL).
- YouTube parser added to extension (returns null unless title has episode marker). `isKnownAnimeSite()` guard added to watch-event API.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (session 17)
- notify.moe integrated via server-side proxy (CORS-blocked in browser). Score bars in DetailModal.
- AniDB, Anime-Planet, Annict, LiveChart reachable via AniList `externalLinks` — no extra API calls.
- Sources page expanded from 9 to 16 entries.

### Session — 2026-06-09 (session 16)
- Discover: hourly cache, member counts, Popular/New Anime sections, dismiss X → `swipe_history` taste profile.
